    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Pre-made polenta, Cajun seasoning, olive oil, and a little salt are all you need for these crispy polenta fries.
        They are great right out of the oven but also good cold. Polenta fries are a healthier alternative than fries
        made from potatoes; they have fewer carbs. Serve with a simple aioli, ketchup, or desired dipping sauce.

    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>

        <li> ½ teaspoon Cajun seasoning</li>

        <li>½ (18 ounce) package prepared polenta, cut into 3/4-inch wedges</li>

        <li>salt to taste</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 356 degrees F (180 degrees C).

        </li>
        <li>Combine oil and Cajun seasoning in a small bowl. Brush seasoned oil onto the polenta wedges with a pastry
            brush. Sprinkle lightly with salt. Place the wedges into the bowl of the air fryer, overlapping slightly if
            needed.

        </li>
        <li>Cook in the preheated air fryer for 10 minutes. Flip carefully with a silicone spatula. Cook, shaking basket
            occasionally and using spatula if wedges stick, until crispy, 15 to 20 minutes more.
